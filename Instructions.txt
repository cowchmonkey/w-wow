wow, you don't see this everyday - instructions!!! How many svn's have you dl'd
and were lost!. Well I hope that does not happen here.
Ok first things first


1. Go to the img folder
2. right click on the icons.7z and select "EXTRACT HERE"
3. make a db called vwow
4. go to the sql folder and import that using your fav sql manager. I use navicat.
5. Edit the config.php.dist
6. Rename it to config.php

WARNING: This app is NO DONE! There will be a text file called FINAL RELEASE when
it is. Until then, no trolls!!!
