<h1>YIKES!</h1>
You just missed it! We were putting up this page, and a stark raving imp came
alone and ran off with it, most likely thinking it was a return spell or
something similar. 
Looks like the only page they took was this one:<br/><BR/>
<CENTER><font color="ORANGE"><B><?php echo $_SESSION['page_err'];?></B></font></CENTER>
<p/>
Well for whatever reason, we now have to recreate this page. So check back later
and see if the gnomes have got their act together.
