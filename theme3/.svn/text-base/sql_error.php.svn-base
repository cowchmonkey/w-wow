<H1>HERE WE GO!</H1>
Goofy gnomes are, as usual, tuning up the SQL engine, however, it would appeart
 that they have jammed up something. They just brought you the latest results:
 <br/><br/><center>
 <font color="ORANGE">
    <?php echo $_SESSION['sql_error'];?>
 </font>
 </center><br/>
 <br/>
 See if there is something you can do about it, if not you will have to get
  a hold of one of the Azeroth deities.

<?php
    // KILL EVERYTHING SO WE CAN START OVER
    //unset($_SESSION['sql_error']);
    //unset($_SESSION['userid']);
?>
